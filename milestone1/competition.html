    <h2>Here are my thoughts about this website right here: <a href="https://asana.com/"> asana</a> </h2>
    <br>
    <h2>Here are the positives sides of this website</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>This website has some good contrast at the start. Having some colors with it too.</li>
        <li>This has some good basic navigation bar. With the logo heading back to the main website</li>
        <li>Has a globe button to change language of the website without using the help with translating.</li>
        <li>Has videos and animations that gives out to the website.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Here are the negative sides of this website.</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>There's a banner on the top of the page that doesn't seem like it fits in well.</li>
        <li>There's an AI chat bot that takes up 1/4 the page. Making the user to click the X button.</li>
        <li>There's a scroll bar on the bottom of the page that serves little to no purpose.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Here are some changes that I wanted to do.</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Adjust the page so there isn't a scroll bar at the bottom</li>
        <li>Having the AI bot to be smaller or just to be an icon.</li>
        <li>having the banner below the navigation so everything stays the same spot.</li>
    </ul>
